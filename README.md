### Project Objective
Our platform stands out by integrating user feedback in the form of comments and by allowing users to subscribe for regular fruit deliveries, ensuring they never run out of their favorites. Each product detail page is meticulously designed to provide comprehensive information about the fruit, along with promoting related fruit products, thus giving users an enhanced shopping experience.

### Features
1) Customers: User Authentication
Customers can register for a personal account to track their orders, manage their subscriptions, and maintain a profile. This secure system ensures users' data is safeguarded and enhances the personalized shopping experience.

2) Customers: Add, remove fruit from the shopping carts
Once logged in, users can seamlessly add their favorite fruits to their shopping cart. They also have the freedom to modify their cart by removing items if they change their mind.

3) Customers: Subscription fruit order
For those who wish for regular fruit deliveries, there's an option to subscribe. Users can choose the frequency of their orders, ensuring they always have fresh produce at their disposal.

4) Customers: Leave comments

5) Admin Dashboard
A comprehensive dashboard for shop owners and administrators. This tool helps in managing inventory, tracking sales, monitoring user feedback, and ensuring smooth operations. It's an essential feature that provides a real-time overview of the business and aids in strategic decision-making.
